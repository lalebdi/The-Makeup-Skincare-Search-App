## The Makeup & Skincare Search App:
<br />
The makeup and skincare industries are billion dollar industries with continuous innovation and advancement. 
<br />
<br />
Everyone is unique in their reaction to different ingredients in the skincare, or have different concerns that they want to address. This search app will help you see the ingredients and so you know what you are investing in. Also, to avoid anything that can provoke any interaction with your skincare stables or your body, so you avoid any unwanted side effects.
<br />
<br />
Similar to skincare, makeup can be overwhelming. There are a lot of makeup products out there and often it is hard to choose. In this app, we collected the makeup stables. These are the most popular ones, not seasonal. You can see the different shades, prices and what brands carry.  

<br />
<br />

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

<br />


### `APIs`

I'm using 2 large APIs for this project. One for skincare and the other is for makeup.

<br />
The skincare API: https://skincare-api.herokuapp.com <br/>
The makeup API : http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json

### `Tech Challenges:`

Mainly time, however, I would like to implement some of React's features:
<br />
1- React Router.
<br />
2- Axios.
<br />
3- React Hooks.
<br />
4- React Bootstrap.
<br />
5- Sping.
<br />
6- Animated NavBar.
